# SimpleFileCompressor  

Implement File Compressor using Huffman Code Algorithm

Works perfectly on all types of files  

# Issue   
Can't compress big size file

# 0.1 ver.   

<img src="./Screenshots/01ver.png" width="30%" height="30%">   

Implement GUI with TornadoFx   
Refactoring source structure   

0.1 version has only compress function.   
Compress original file to .grml file   


### TODO    
Connect decompress function to GUI   
Inject header information to .grml file    

# Concept Version   

## before size (original) 367B  

<img src="./Screenshots/before.png" width="30%" height="30%">   

## compressed size 25B  

<img src="./Screenshots/comp.png" width="30%" height="30%">  

## decompressed 367B  

<img src="./Screenshots/decomp.png" width="30%" height="30%">  

### TODO
=======================================  
Add more detailed explanation to README.md  
Make GUI  
Clean up source codes  



~~Make it work for all types of files~~  
->I solved this problem by changing structure from string-based to byte-based
