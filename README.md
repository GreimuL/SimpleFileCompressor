<img src="./Screenshots/comp.png" width="30%" height="30%">  

## decompressed 367B  

<img src="./Screenshots/decomp.png" width="30%" height="30%">  

TODO
=======================================  
Add more detailed explanation to README.md  
Make it available for actual use  
Clean up source codes  


~~Make it work for all types of files  ~~
~~### -Guess why it doesn't work with other types-  ~~
~~I think there is a problem with toString when read file. Maybe string doesn't surpport certain characters.~~
~~So, I'll change structure from string-based to byte-based~~
